Pick a named layout pattern from references/catalog.md that best fits this page's role, density, and asset mix. Re-layout .ppt-page-content to follow that pattern's zone skeleton — grid/flex columns, zone heights, title bar, breathing room. Deliver a creative redesign and material re-composition within the selected style, not a cosmetic class edit. Preserve the original wording by default; when the page is too dense to remain legible, use a concise, faithful summary and regroup the content instead of shrinking text.`,
